## ðŸŒŸ About the Project

This repository serves as a **digital library of book notes**. Each markdown file represents a specific book, where I summarize the key lessons, quotes, and personal reflections.

The purpose is to:
- Summarize and capture key takeaways from each book.
- Provide quick access to helpful lessons and ideas.
- Serve as a personal knowledge repository and reference guide.
